    "author": "By James Doe",
    "date": "Jun 29, 2025",
    "introParagraph": "Design is more than just visuals — it’s how your brand communicates, builds trust, and guides users. Startups often move fast, but skipping thoughtful design can cost time, money, and credibility. Let’s explore five common startup design mistakes — and how to avoid them.",

    "mistakes": [
      {
        "title": "Lack of a Clear Brand Identity",
        "mistake": "Many startups begin without a consistent logo, color palette, typography, or brand tone. This leads to disjointed marketing materials and user confusion.",
        "fix": "Create a brand style guide early on. Define your logo usage, brand colors, fonts, and tone of voice. This helps keep everything consistent — from your website to pitch decks."
      },
      {
        "title": "Overcomplicating the User Experience (UX)",
        "mistake": "Trying to be innovative, many startups add too many features or unusual interactions. The result? Confused users who drop off quickly.",
        "fix": "Focus on simplicity. Identify your core user goal, and remove friction in achieving it. Test with real users and get feedback early. Good design is invisible — it just works."
      },
      {
        "title": "Using Templates Without Customization",
        "mistake": "Relying entirely on website builders or generic UI kits without branding them results in a product that looks like everyone else’s.",
        "fix": "Use templates as a foundation, not a final product. Customize layouts, fonts, icons, and colors to reflect your unique value. Investing a little time in design refinement goes a long way."
      },
      {
        "title": "Ignoring Mobile-First Design",
        "mistake": "Startups often design for desktop first and only “shrink it down” for mobile — missing mobile-specific usability needs.",
        "fix": "Think mobile-first. Over 60% of users browse from mobile. Prioritize performance, accessibility, and simple interfaces that work flawlessly on small screens."
      }
    ],

    "finalThoughts": "Startups that invest in smart, consistent design from the beginning stand out, gain user trust, and scale faster. You don’t need to be a design expert — but avoiding these five mistakes will put you miles ahead.",
